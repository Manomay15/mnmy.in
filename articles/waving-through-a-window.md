# Waving Through A Window

“When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around  
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?  
Did I even make a sound?  
Did I even make a sound?  
It's like I never made a sound  
Will I ever make a sound?”  

These are lines from one of my favorite songs, “Waving Through A Window” performed by Ben Platt. While he takes you through the emotions of a socially awkward teenager, these lines go way beyond that.

Did something happen if there was no observer?

This has been explored in pop science on different lines where they believe that the act of looking at something changes it. This is called the **Observer Effect**, but while we mere mortals consider observers as someone with consciousness, nerds openly call a rock an observer. So quantum mechanics has it clear, but what about a school of thought that is not science?

I wonder if miracles are happening all over the earth but we are just too ignorant to observe them. Maybe turtles sprint in the Amazon or fishes fly from the fish tank you have when you’re asleep. Maybe they just don’t do this when they sense an observer. A *conscious* observer. Is that why you can see unnatural things in your dreams as you are not fully conscious? This does mean that an observer can make things happen or make things not happen. When Ben Platt asks if he crashed or made a sound when falling in a forest, he will be an observer too, right? He will be hurt, and there will be a sound, but he says it was like he never made a sound. It felt like he never made a sound because no observer reacted to it. Can’t we consider ourselves as observers?

Once I was on a trip when I took a walk on a hill that had trees all around. It felt as if I was in a Bear Grylls setting and one wrong turn would make me fight for my life. As I was second-guessing my choices, you won’t believe what I saw next. A monkey with her kid on her back had two stones in her hand and was teaching a cow how to make fire using rocks. I know you won’t believe me but is a lie even a lie if no one knows the truth? It is a lie because we know it is a lie, else we will just be lying to ourselves and maybe that’s also why it is considered immoral.

It is also funny how morality, rules, and lines between ethical & unethical can be bent as per human convenience. This happens almost always when you are left to choose between bad & more bad while often both are equally bad. Would you rather kill an ant or a butterfly? I am almost certain our race will come together as one and decide one thing is more okay than the other while both are equally bad. We’ve been made in a way to sympathize with beauty. Why were we made like this? Can we even put this on someone?

You can never end a thought with an answer as it always leads to more questions, but here I’ll end it as I started with Ben Platt saying:

“I try to speak, but nobody can hear  
So I wait around for an answer to appear  
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass  
Waving through a window, oh  
Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?”
