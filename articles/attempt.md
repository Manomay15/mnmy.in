# Sub: An Attempt

Hey,

It's been a while. I hope this mail finds you well. No, you aren't at fault for not expecting it. I want to believe you had a hope though. I don't even know if you'll recognize me from this mail; don't feel bad if you won't, but I hope you do.

Yesterday I came across a piece we wrote in our good old days. I read it, and it had lost its magic. It didn't feel like before. There was no glimmer in my eyes, nor you beside me to recite it to. It was different. Pretty bland, to be precise. Maybe the words were never the magic. I was in love with the process. The purpose. And I've never felt the same again. I've felt better, but never the same.

Have you been writing lately? I would love to read some of your latest thoughts. We should maybe do one of our sessions if you are up for it. It will be fun, I promise. Let me know. Reliving memories is truly a unique experience. Can we call it time travel? Or will it just be a different timeline? We would definitely look different. I haven't seen you in years. *Warning: I've gained weight hehe*

In case we never see each other again, I have a few things to confess. I would trade anything right now to go back in time and do something different which wouldn't take me to today. Maybe we could have published a book? I don't even know the worth of words. Do they only have meaning when written for someone or something?

I started writing because you used to, not because I had a knack for it or anything deep. It was the only thing common between us, so I did. Please don't feel betrayed, I loved every moment I've written ever since. Sometimes it doesn't even make sense, but it is always worth it. It has literally no boundaries, no censorship, and people also find it cool. You have no idea how many crazy directions I've gone in, but I'd like to keep it with me. Right now I'm trying to achieve a way of writing which, when read, plays a movie in the reader's head with everything coming alive. I feel once you make someone cry through fiction, you have a superpower. What are your thoughts?

I miss these conversations. I have no one to open my mind to. It feels like I'm justifying something. I think I am, but don't know what. *Btw I have also jumped into a new genre of music.* But mails should be short, so let's keep that for when we meet?

*Yours?*
