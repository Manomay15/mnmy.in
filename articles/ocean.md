# Ocean

“Are you sure you want to do it?” I asked her nervously as we were in our scuba gear amidst the ocean and about to jump. She looked at me, held my hand, and took a jump. We were in. Water, water everywhere. I was scared; she wasn't. We went deeper into the blue with her tightly holding my hand. She always did this when nervous.

We went deeper down. There were fishes of all colours you can think of. It was beautiful. Our grip began to get loose as we felt comfortable. I could hear a rhythm. Maybe it was our heartbeats or more certainly just the small waves hitting our bodies. I wanted to believe the former so that I could put the blame on our love. Yes, I am that dumb. But she loves me, so why complain?

We had met on a train. Obviously, she started the conversation as I was in her seat. Rather, it was just a one-way dialogue. I'm glad it happened though, as I got to know I was in the wrong coach altogether. I'm glad for the other reason too :)

And then we took it from there. I don't know how, but I'm glad. It's been 3 years since. We usually go out of our comfort zones to be more comfortable with each other. This was my idea. The diving thing was also my plan. We were floating around like little astronauts in the infinite. We just had a bit more living creatures around for company. Maybe astronauts have them too, but they just haven't told us.

I could see her admiring what she was seeing, but I was still nervous. I knew what was coming. She didn't.

I interrupted her exploration at a reef. She worriedly looked back with a face of “Is all okay?”. I stared at her for a few seconds. Reached out to my left pocket and went down on one knee (metaphorically). She was speechless. I left her speechless. In fact, I did this just to brag that I left her speechless once for the rest of my life.
