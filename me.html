                <p>I travel, I fall into internet rabbit holes and I start projects which never really end.
                In my early twenties which means I'm as confused as a toddler when they see a new person or a grandpa figuring 
                how to start a video call. But in life.

                <p>
                    I have this urge to experience everything which this planet has to offer. Most of my trips are solo as I'm in love with the anonimity it offers
                    and being big sucker for having no schedule, it helps. Right now exploring the north of India one long weekend at a time where I've met some amazing people,
                    heard amazing stories & had conversations which I still think of.

                <p>Sports have always been close to my heart. Whether playing or watching, I enjoy the thrill, teamwork, and determination that sports bring out in people. It’s a great way to stay active and engaged.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: left;">Trivia</h3>
                <p>Trivia keeps my curiosity alive! I love collecting random facts, solving puzzles, and challenging myself with knowledge from all kinds of fields. It’s fun and keeps me sharp!</p>
