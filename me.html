                <p>I travel, I fall into internet rabbit holes and I start projects which never really end.
                In my early twenties which means I'm as confused as a toddler when they see a new person or a grandpa figuring 
                how to start a video call. But in life.

                <p>
                    I have this urge to experience everything which this planet has to offer. Most of my trips are solo as I'm in love with the anonimity it offers
                    and being big sucker for having no schedule, it helps. Right now exploring the north of India one long weekend at a time where I've met some amazing people,
                    heard amazing stories & had conversations which I still think of. 
                    <br><br>
                    Planning to post a map with pins to places I've been sooon...

                <h3 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"">Podcasts</h3>
                <p>
                    I like listening to conversations. Conversations with a level of expertise and/or humour which I can't be a part
                    of in my daily life. I've been listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQxSBNMexBQE4beiEMRJUXxrqQnzw5-Xc">The Internet Said So</a> since forever and also really into the Indian comedy podcast scene
                    with my latest bingeworthy recommendation being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SpenderBender">Spender Bender</a> if you know the people.
                    <br>
                    The idea of having a connect with people you can only listen to is inherently weird because none of the feelings are reciprocated
                    but somehow listening to them is comforting. It has helped during bad days and sometimes even made a day much better but I guess having
                    an external source to feel better is a lot of dependency?
                </p>


                <h3 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">Trivia</h3>
                <p>
                    A very recent fascination I've built is towards good trivia. Getting to know a fact or a story behind a well known fact
                    feels amazing. It often ends with "Why do I know this?" but the fact of learning something new which is not "taught" gives
                    that small dopamine rush enough to keep searching for the next story.
